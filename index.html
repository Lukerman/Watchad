  <h1>What is Cryptocurrency?</h1>
  <p>
    Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security. 
    Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (fiat money), cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. 
    Popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL).

  <h2>How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h2>
  <p>
    Cryptocurrencies work on a decentralized network of computers, called nodes, which verify transactions and add them to a public ledger known as the blockchain.
    Transactions are secure, irreversible, and transparent.

  <h2>Why is Cryptocurrency Important?</h2>
  <p>
    Cryptocurrency offers new financial opportunities and empowers people with faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions.
    It also allows individuals to have full control over their money, especially in regions with unstable financial systems.

  <p>
    Always do your own research before investing in any cryptocurrency, as the market is volatile and unpredictable.
